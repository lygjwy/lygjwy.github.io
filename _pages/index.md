# ü§µüèª Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) (China, Nanjing), supervised by Prof. [Chongjun Wang](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/58/06/c2639a153606/pagem.htm) and [Junyuan Xie](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/58/21/c2639a153633/pagem.htm).
During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to work as a research intern in the group of Prof. [Hongxin Wei](https://hongxin001.github.io/) in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/) at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) (China, Shenzhen) from Jul 2023 to Dec 2024.
Previously, I obtained my B.E. from the [College of Software Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) (China, Nanjing) in Jul 2020.
Prior to that, I spent a wonderful time as an engineering intern in the Web Experience Team at the Microsoft Software Technology Center Asia (China, Suzhou) in 2019.

My research focuses on  [Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI)](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/), which aims to **develop high-quality datasets** in real-world machine learning applications.
This process usually involves data collection and labeling, handling out-of-distribution samples, selecting the coreset, and data augmentation.
Our emphasis now is on exploring **the underlying mechanism behind the well-known scaling law from a data perspective** - a decisive driver of the frontier models, such as large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs.
More details about my research topics are presented [here]().
Last but not least, **I am always open to collaboration for something fun and valuable**!

Currently, I am looking for a full-time job in industry or academia. Here is my [CV](../assets/CV-en.pdf). If you find a good match, feel free to contact me.
